Alliance of Information and Referral Systems (AIRS) Linked Open Vocabulary
==========

This is a Linked Open Vocabulary for information and referral (I&R) resource data.

It conveys the same concepts within the AIRS XML Schema https://code.google.com/p/airs-xml/source/browse/tags/3.1/airs.xsd, except using Linked Data.  Linked Data entails type reuse from popular related vocabularies, and webs of relationships, as opposed to hierarchies.  

We also have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ejahn.net/document/d/19PcmoBfRuftBgS04fBK5kPN3U1LA0h-d8wwwqgmENiQ/edit#">definitions page</a> we need help editing.  It contains definitions for all the AIRS Linked Data terms.
