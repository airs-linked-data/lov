AIRS Linked Open Vocabulary
==========

This is a Linked Open Vocabulary for information and referral (I&R) resource data.

It conveys the same concepts within the AIRS XML Schema https://code.google.com/p/airs-xml/source/browse/tags/3.1/airs.xsd, except using Linked Data, which entails type reuse from popular related vocabularies, and webs of relationships, as opposed to hierarchies.
