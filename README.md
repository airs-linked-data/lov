Alliance of Information and Referral Systems (AIRS) Linked Open Vocabulary
==========

This is a Linked Open Vocabulary for information and referral (I&R) resource data, for use anywhere in the world, by anyone helping people out with human services.  Because it's Linked Data, you can add your own fields to it, and it won't break it.

It conveys the same concepts within the AIRS XML Schema https://github.com/airsalliance/airs-xml, except using Linked Data.  Linked Data entails type reuse from popular related vocabularies, and webs of relationships, as opposed to hierarchies.  

We also have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ejahn.net/document/d/19PcmoBfRuftBgS04fBK5kPN3U1LA0h-d8wwwqgmENiQ/edit#">definitions page</a> we need help editing.  It contains definitions for all the AIRS Linked Data terms.
